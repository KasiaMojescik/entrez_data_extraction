However, the distance-based clustering methods usually cannot perform well in high dimensions and even begin to fail. In this paper, we propose a new active learning method combined with variational autoencoder (VAE) and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN). It overcomes the difficulty of distance representation in high dimensions and prevents the distance concentration phenomenon from occurring in the computational learning literature with respect to high-dimensional p-norms. Finally, we compare our method with four common active learning methods and two other clustering algorithms combined with VAE on three datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance, and it is a new batch mode active learning algorithm designed for neural networks with a relatively small query batch size.","['Chen, Fang', 'Zhang, Tao', 'Liu, Ruilin']","['Chen F', 'Zhang T', 'Liu R']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5247-7201', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3165-2824', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6335-1228']","['School of Information and Mathematics, Yangtze University, Jingzhou 434023, China', 'School of Information and Mathematics, Yangtze University, Jingzhou 434023, China', 'School of Information and Mathematics, Yangtze University, Jingzhou 434023, China']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210730,['61673006'],"['2021/03/11 [received]', '2021/07/05 [revised]', '2021/07/20 [accepted]']",Comput Intell Neurosci,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,['10.1155/2021/9952596 [doi]'],Comput Intell Neurosci. 2021 Jul 30;2021:. doi:10.1155/2021/9952596.,,,,,

Surgery is the only curative modality for early-stage CRC. The aim of this study was to evaluate the oxidative damage biomarkers as well as enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants in patients with CRC before and after tumor resection and in healthy controls. 60 patients with stage I/II colorectal adenocarcinoma and 43 healthy controls were recruited in this study. We measured plasma levels of oxidative damage biomarkers, including advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), advanced glycation end products (AGEs), malondialdehyde (MDA), and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) at baseline and after tumor removal. We also evaluated the plasma activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) as enzymatic antioxidants and the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay for nonenzymatic antioxidant capacity. Patients with CRC had significantly higher AGE, AOPP, MDA, and ox-LDL and also FRAP levels and higher SOD and GPx and lower CAT activity levels compared to healthy controls (p < 0.05). We did not observe any statistically significant correlation between redox biomarkers and the size and stage of the tumor. AGEs (72.49 ± 4.7 vs. 67.93 ± 8.8, p < 0.001), AOPP (137.64 ± 21.9 vs. 119.08 ± 33.1, p < 0.001), MDA (3.56 ± 0.30 vs. 3.05 ± 0.33, p < 0.001), and ox-LDL (19.78 ± 0.97 vs. 16.94 ± 1.02, p < 0.001) concentrations reduced significantly after tumor removal. The largest effect sizes were found in ox-LDL (d = −2.853, 95% CI 2.50-3.19) and MDA (d = −1.617, 95% CI 0.43-0.57). Serum FRAP levels (1097.5 ± 156.7 vs. 1239.3 ± 290, p < 0.001) and CAT (2.34 ± 0.34 vs. 2.63 ± 0.38, p < 0.001), GPx (102.37 ± 6.58 vs. 108.03 ± 6.95, p < 0.001), and SOD (5.13 ± 0.39 vs. 5.53 ± 0.31, p < 0.001) activity levels increased significantly after surgery. The largest effect sizes among antioxidants were seen in SOD (d = 1.135, 95% CI 0.46-0.34) and GPx (d = 0.836, 95% CI 0.35-0.23). This study indicated that patients with colorectal cancer had higher levels of oxidative stress and antioxidant activity compared to healthy controls.

In this study, a multiobject detection method based on deep convolutional neural network that can achieve nondestructive detection of rail surface and fastener defects is proposed. First, rails and fasteners on the railway track image are localized by the improved YOLOv5 framework. Then, the defect detection model based on Mask R-CNN is utilized to detect the surface defects of the rail and segment the defect area. Finally, the model based on ResNet framework is used to classify the state of the fasteners.

Although the two issues have drawn enough attention separately, the joint treatment largely remains unexplored. Moreover, the class imbalance issue is further complicated if data streams with concept drift. A novel Cost-Sensitive based Data Stream (CSDS) classification is introduced to overcome the two issues simultaneously. The CSDS considers cost information during the procedures of data preprocessing and classification. During the data preprocessing, a cost-sensitive learning strategy is introduced into the ReliefF algorithm for alleviating the class imbalance at the data level. In the classification process, a cost-sensitive weighting schema is devised to enhance the overall performance of the ensemble. Besides, a change detection mechanism is embedded in our algorithm, which guarantees that an ensemble can capture and react to drift promptly. Experimental results validate that our method can obtain better classification results under different imbalanced concept drifting data stream scenarios.","['Sun, Yange', 'Li, Meng', 'Li, Lei', 'Shao, Han', 'Sun, Yi']","['Sun Y', 'Li M', 'Li L', 'Shao H', 'Sun Y']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3305-4622'],"['School of Computer and Information Technology, Xinyang Normal University, Xinyang 464000, China', 'School of Computer and Information Technology, Xinyang Normal University, Xinyang 464000, China', 'School of Computer and Information Technology, Xinyang Normal University, Xinyang 464000, China', 'School of Computer and Information Technology, Xinyang Normal University, Xinyang 464000, China', 'Institute of Zhengzhou Information Science and Technology, Zhengzhou, China']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210802,['62062004'],"['2020/08/07 [received]', '2021/07/04 [revised]', '2021/07/21 [accepted]']",Comput Intell Neurosci,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,['10.1155/2021/8813806 [doi]'],Comput Intell Neurosci. 2021 Aug 2;2021:. doi:10.1155/2021/8813806.,,,,,

The M-current is a voltage-gated potassium current modulated mainly by cholinergic signaling. KCNQ subunits ensemble into ion channels responsible for the M-current. In the central nervous system, KCNQ4 expression is restricted to certain brainstem structures such as the RAS nuclei. Here, we investigated the presence and functional significance of KCNQ4 in the PPN by behavioral studies and the gene and protein expressions and slice electrophysiology using a mouse model lacking KCNQ4 expression. We found that this mouse has alterations in the adaptation to changes in light–darkness cycles, representing the potential role of KCNQ4 in the regulation of the sleep–wakefulness cycle. As cholinergic neurons from the PPN participate in the regulation of this cycle, we investigated whether the cholinergic PPN might also possess functional KCNQ4 subunits. Although the M-current is an electrophysiological hallmark of cholinergic neurons, only a subpopulation of them had KCNQ4-dependent M-current. Interestingly, the absence of the KCNQ4 subunit altered the expression patterns of the other KCNQ subunits in the PPN. We also determined that, in wild-type animals, the cholinergic inputs of the PPN modulated the M-current, and these in turn can modulate the level of synchronization between neighboring PPN neurons. Taken together, the KCNQ4 subunit is present in a subpopulation of PPN cholinergic neurons, and it may contribute to the regulation of the sleep–wakefulness cycle.","['Bayasgalan, T.', 'Stupniki, S.', 'Kovács, A.', 'Csemer, A.', 'Szentesi, P.', 'Pocsai, K.', 'Dionisio, L.', 'Spitzmaul, G.', 'Pál, B.']","['Bayasgalan T', 'Stupniki S', 'Kovács A', 'Csemer A', 'Szentesi P', 'Pocsai K', 'Dionisio L', 'Spitzmaul G', 'Pál B']",,"['Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary', 'Instituto de Investigaciones Bioquímicas de Bahía Blanca (INIBIBB), Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET), Universidad Nacional Del Sur (UNS), Bahía Blanca, Argentina', 'Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary', 'Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary', 'Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary', 'Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary', 'Instituto de Investigaciones Bioquímicas de Bahía Blanca (INIBIBB), Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET), Universidad Nacional Del Sur (UNS), Bahía Blanca, Argentina', 'Instituto de Investigaciones Bioquímicas de Bahía Blanca (INIBIBB), Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET), Universidad Nacional Del Sur (UNS), Bahía Blanca, Argentina', 'Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210726,,"['2021/05/10 [received]', '2021/06/28 [accepted]']",Front Cell Neurosci,Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience,['10.3389/fncel.2021.707789 [doi]'],Front Cell Neurosci. 2021 Jul 26;15:. doi:10.3389/fncel.2021.707789.,,,,,

In the present experiments, we tested the effects of EUK-207 on oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced cell death in cultured hippocampal slices and on several mechanisms that have been postulated to participate in this process. Cultured hippocampal slices were subjected to 1 h OGD followed by 3 or 24 h recovery in regular medium with glucose and oxygen. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in culture medium and propidium iodide (PI) uptake in slices were used to evaluate cell viability. When EUK-207 was applied either 1 or 2 h before OGD, OGD-induced LDH release was significantly reduced. When EUK-207 was applied 1 h before OGD and during 24 h recovery, PI uptake was also reduced. OGD-induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was evaluated with the fluorescent probe DCF. DCF fluorescence in slices increased steadily during OGD treatment, rapidly disappeared following return to regular medium before slowly increasing again during the 24 h recovery period. When measured 3 h after OGD, increased ROS levels were significantly reduced by EUK-207. OGD also increased lipid peroxidation levels and this effect was also reduced by EUK-207 6 h following OGD. Cytosolic cytochrome c and nuclear apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) were increased 3 h after OGD, and the translocation of AIF from mitochondria to nucleus was partly blocked by treatment with EUK-207. In conclusion, EUK-207 provides neuroprotection against OGD-induced cell death in cultured hippocampal slices. As EUK-207 prevents free radical formation and lipid peroxidation, the neuroprotection is related to elimination of free radical generation and lipid peroxidation, as well as to decreased activation of pro-apoptotic factors. Our data support the further clinical evaluation of this class of molecules for the prevention of ischemic cell damage.","['Zhou, Miou', 'Baudry, Michel']","['Zhou M', 'Baudry M']",,,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20081101,,,Brain Res,Brain research,['10.1016/j.brainres.2008.10.016 [doi]'],Brain Res. 2009 Jan 09;1247:28-37.

7,PMC8351982,1932-6203 (Electronic),16,2021,Innovation in unruptured intracranial aneurysm coiling: At which price or efficacy are new technologies cost-effective?,e0255870,"Background: Unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIA) are increasingly being treated by endovascular coiling as opposed to open surgical clipping. Unfortunately, endovascular coiling imparts an approximate 25% recanalization rate, leading to additional procedures and increased rupture risk. While a new health technology innovation (HTI) that reduces this recanalization rate would benefit patients, few advancements have been made. We aim to determine whether cost-effectiveness has been a barrier to HTI. Methods: A probabilistic Markov model was constructed from the healthcare payer perspective to compare standard endovascular treatment of UIA to standard treatment plus the addition of a HTI adjunct. Costs were measured in 2018 USD and health outcomes were measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALY). In the base case, the HTI was a theoretical mesenchymal stem cell therapy which reduced the aneurysm recanalization rate by 50% and cost $10,000 per procedure. All other model inputs were derived from the published scientific literature. Results: Based on the model results, we found that for a given HTI price (y) and relative risk reduction of aneurysm recanalization (x), the HTI was always cost-effective if the following equation was satisfied: y ≤ 20268 ∙ x, using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY. The uncertainty surrounding whether an aneurysm would recanalize was a significant driver within the model. When the uncertainty around the risk of aneurysm recanalization was eliminated, the 10-year projected additional benefit to the United States healthcare system was calculated to be $113,336,994. Conclusion: Cost-effectiveness does not appear to be a barrier to innovation in reducing the recanalization rate of UIA treated by endovascular coil embolization. Our model can now be utilized by academia and industry to accentuate economically feasible HTI and by healthcare payers to calculate their maximum willingness-to-pay for a new technology. Our results also indicate that predicting a patient’s baseline risk of aneurysm recanalization is a critical area of future research.","['Ben-Israel, David', 'Belanger, Brooke L.', 'Adibi, Amin', 'Eesa, Muneer', 'Mitha, Alim P.', 'Spackman, Eldon']","['Ben-Israel D', 'Belanger BL', 'Adibi A', 'Eesa M', 'Mitha AP', 'Spackman E']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6120-5435', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1091-4239', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2748-4781']","['Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada', 'Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada', 'Collaboration for Outcomes Research and Evaluation, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada', 'Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada', 'Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada', 'O’Brien Institute for Public Health, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210809,,"['2021/06/17 [received]', '2021/07/26 [accepted]']",PLoS One,PLoS ONE,"['10.1371/journal.pone.0255870 [doi]', 'PONE-D-21-19881 [pii]']",PLoS One. 2021 Aug 9;16(8):. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0255870.,,,,8,

Utilizing a fluorescent reporter Mtb strain in a chemical screen, we have identified compounds that dysregulate Mtb response to high Cl− levels, with a subset of the hits also inhibiting Mtb growth in host macrophages. Structure–activity relationship studies on the hit compound “C6,” or 2-(4-((2-(ethylthio)pyrimidin-5-yl)methyl)piperazin-1-yl)benzo[d]oxazole, demonstrated a correlation between compound perturbation of Mtb Cl− response and inhibition of bacterial growth in macrophages. C6 accumulated in both bacterial and host cells, and inhibited Mtb growth in cholesterol media, but not in rich media. Subsequent examination of the Cl− response of Mtb revealed an intriguing link with bacterial growth in cholesterol, with increased transcription of several Cl−-responsive genes in the simultaneous presence of cholesterol and high external Cl− concentration, versus transcript levels observed during exposure to high external Cl− concentration alone. Strikingly, oral administration of C6 was able to inhibit Mtb growth in vivo in a C3HeB/FeJ murine infection model.
